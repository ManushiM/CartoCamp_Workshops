# CartoCamp_Workshops

The IPython has contents for an 'Introduction to OSMnx for Routing' workshop conducted by me at Carto, Brooklyn on 28th April 2107.

Topics touched upon include:
* Introduction to OSMnx
* Extracting boundary shapefiles
* Extracting street networks
* Basic spatial analysis
* Finding shortest distance from origin to destination
* Detecting walkable distance within 5,10,15 mins from a location
* Extracting data for external use
* Visualizing results internaly and externaly

Outputs generated while executing the scripts in the notebook have been saved in the 'osmnx_outputFiles' folder.

In order to run these scripts on your own machine, clone this repository and install all necessary packages (Networkx, Geopandas, Matplotlib, Rtree, OSMnx, Pandas, Numpy, Descartes, Folium).
